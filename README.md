### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an R enthusiast and a lifelong student. Now a Full Stack Trainee learning my way towards web development and a professional skill set. The purpose of my GitHub page is to slowly build up a repo portfolio to show my skill set - and possibly even share some useful code.

I have decent knowledge in **R** and **Shiny**, which I use mostly for data wrangling and visualization.

I have a basic understanding of:
- Java (and object-oriented programming)
- SQL
- Vanilla Javascript

Also I know a thing or two of:
- Windows
- Linux server management
- Nextcloud and its hosting and management
- AWS and Azure
- Most common office programs
- Computer hardware and printers, scanners and photocopiers
- Git and GitHub (well you're here aren't you)

Some skills outside of computer world:
- 10 years of customer service experience in large public libraries
- Good knowledge of managing nonprofit organizations (e.g. secretary and treasurer duties)
- Double-entry accounting
- Photography
- Herding cats

I also know something about esports:
- 20 years of experience in sim racing and 8 years in organizing national level competitions and live events
- Lots of experience from sim racing communities
